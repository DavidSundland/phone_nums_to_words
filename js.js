//A program to convert phone numbers to a combination of English words (when possible) - 697-466-3686 could become MYPHONENUM; 724-6837 could become PAINTER
//Computation time may be the biggest challenge - if both numbers AND the corresponding letters are checked, a 10-digit phone number could result in over 1 million combinations, each to be checked against a dictionary of over 50,000 words...
//Some numbers will have multiple results, others will have none.  Since no letters correspond to the 0 or 1 keys, those numbers can't be converted to letters.
